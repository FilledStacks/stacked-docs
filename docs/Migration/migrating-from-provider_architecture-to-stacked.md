Let's start with a statement to ease your migration panic ðŸ˜… stacked is the same code from `provider_architecture` with name changes and removal of some old deprecated properties. If you don't believe me, open the repo's side by side and look at the lib folders. Well, up till yesterday (22 April 2020) I guess when I updated the BaseViewModel. I wanted to do this to show that stacked is production-ready from the go. It's a new package but it's been used by all of you and the FilledStacks development team for months in the form of provider_architecture. With that out of the way, let's start the migrate.

### ViewModelProvider Migration

This class has now been more appropriately named `ViewModelBuilder`. This is to match it's functionality more closely. Building UI FROM the ViewModel. The ViewModel is used to drive the state of the reactive UI.

Migrations to take note of:

- `ViewModelProvider` -> `ViewModelBuilder`
- Named constructor `withoutConsumer` is now called `nonReactive`
- Named constructor `withConsumer` is now called `reactive`
- Instead of passing a constructed `ViewModel` which was constructing every rebuilder we pass a `viewModelBuilder`. A function that returns a `ChangeNotifier`.
- `reuseExisting` has changed to `disposeViewModel` and now has a default value of true. If you used `reuseExisting=true` it has to change to `disposeViewModel=false`.

Let's look at that in code. We'll go over `withoutConsumer/nonReactive` first

```dart
class HomeViewMultipleWidgets extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ViewModelProvider<HomeViewModel>.withoutConsumer(
      viewModel: HomeViewModel(),
      onModelReady: (viewModel) => viewModel.initialise(),
      reuseExisting: true,
      builder: (context, viewModel, _) => Scaffold(
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: () {
            viewModel.updateTitle();
          },
        ),
        body: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[TitleSection(), DescriptionSection()],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Will Change to

```dart
class HomeViewMultipleWidgets extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ViewModelBuilder<HomeViewModel>.nonReactive( // Take note here
      viewModelBuilder: () => HomeViewModel(), // Take note here
      disposeViewModel: false, // Take note here
      onModelReady: (viewModel) => viewModel.initialise(),
      builder: (context, viewModel, _) => Scaffold(
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: () {
            viewModel.updateTitle();
          },
        ),
        body: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[TitleSection(), DescriptionSection()],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

For the `withConsumer` function we do the following

```dart
class HomeView extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ViewModelProvider<HomeViewModel>.withConsumer(
    );
  }
}
```

Changes to

```dart
class HomeView extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ViewModelBuilder<HomeViewModel>.reactive( // Take note here

    );
  }
}
```


### ProviderWidget Migration

The only change here was the name.

```dart
class DuplicateNameWidget extends ProviderWidget<Human> {

}

// Becomes

class DuplicateNameWidget extends ViewModelWidget<Human> {

}
```

The rest of the package is all new functionality which can be seen above. Please check out the issues for tasks we'd like to add. If you would like to see any functionality in here please create an issue and I'll assess and provide feedback.
